# Overview of the Content
<p><em>The Alchemist</em> tells the journey of Santiago, a young shepherd who keeps dreaming of a secret treasure at the foot of the Egyptian pyramids. Deciding to leave his simple but peaceful life behind, he embarks on a challenging and eye-opening adventure. Along the way, Santiago not only seeks a material treasure but also learns profound lessons about life: about destiny, following the call of the heart, and most importantly, persistence despite hardships. His journey shows that the true meaning of life isn’t just the destination but every step along the way, the growth, and self-awareness.</p>

<i>The story isn’t too long, gentle but filled with many memorable quotes that made me stop and reflect. I especially noted down the following ehehe:</i>

<p align="center"><em>"You will never be able to escape your heart. So it’s better to listen to what it says."</em></p>
<p><small>Sometimes I face myself but forget I need to respect my true feelings and desires.</small></p>

<p align="center"><em>"You must always know what you want."</em></p>
<p><small>It’s important to have clear goals and what you’re aiming for to avoid getting lost.</small></p>

<p align="center"><em>"What you believe yourself to be is what you really are."</em></p>
<p><small>This reminds me of the story about judging a fish by its ability to climb a tree — self-belief matters so much; it deeply affects how we act and the outcomes we get in life.</small></p>

<p align="center"><em>"Your eyes show the strength of your soul."</em></p>
<p><small>I really enjoy looking into someone’s eyes because I can feel so many emotions through them. Even though my eyes are a bit dark, I still love eye contact ehehe.</small></p>

<p align="center"><em>"When you love, you always try to become better. When you strive to be perfect, everything around you becomes better too."</em></p>
<p><small>Love blooms like a flower in the heart, motivating us to improve ourselves and make the world around us more beautiful.</small></p>

<p align="center"><em>"A person is loved because they are worthy of love. There is no reason needed to love."</em></p>
<p><small>Love is unconditional, no reasons or conditions required.</small></p>

<p align="center"><em>"Remember, where your heart is, there you will find your treasure."</em></p>
<p><small>Simply put, when you love something, someone, or a place, that’s where joy and meaning are for you hihi.</small></p>

<p align="center"><em>"The only thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve is the fear of failure."</em></p>
<p><small>From my perspective, I often tell myself: “Just do it, failing is better than doing nothing.” That way, I don’t feel pressure or fear of failing when I start something. And if something scares me but I can’t drop it, I just drop it anyway, haha!</small></p>

<p align="center"><em>"At any moment in life, everyone has the ability to realize what they dream."</em></p>
<p><small>This makes me think of two things: first, it’s never too late to pursue your dreams. Second, I always try to enjoy the moment — from work to life kkk.</small></p>

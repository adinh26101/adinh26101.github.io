## 1. Introduction

**Radio Frequency Fingerprinting (RFF)** is a technique for identifying radio devices based on unique characteristics (*fingerprints*) generated by **hardware imperfections** during RF signal transmission.

- Each device (WiFi, IoT, phones, drones, etc.) inherently has **small unavoidable errors** in circuits (*oscillator, PA, DAC...*) when transmitting.  
- These imperfections create a **distinct electromagnetic “fingerprint.”**  
- By **extracting these features** from received signals (e.g., *IQ imbalance, phase noise, transient, spectral features*…), devices can be identified and distinguished even when using **the same communication standard and MAC/IP address.**  

### Main applications of RFF
- **Wireless network security**: detect impersonation, prevent spoofing.  
- **IoT**: lightweight device identification and authentication without heavy protocols.  
- **Military & Drones**: distinguish unmanned aerial vehicles.

## 2. Related Work

### Transient Signal Identification
Studies show that the *transient* stage in radio signals (between noise and steady state) contains key features for device identification. Precisely detecting the *transient* boundary is crucial to avoid errors affecting feature extraction and training.  

Common detection methods:
- **Bayesian change point detection**: based on *fractal dimension* changes.  
- **Phase-Based detection**: based on linear phase variations during the *transient* stage.  

### Machine Learning and Deep Learning Applications
Once the *transient* signal is extracted, supervised machine learning models like **SVM** perform well but heavily rely on accurate transient segmentation.  

To overcome this, **deep learning (CNN, LSTM)** leverages the full signal, reducing dependence on transient detection and improving accuracy. Recent models such as **RiftNet** have been applied to identify devices from smartphone Bluetooth signals.

## 3. Method

### Signal Classification with Machine Learning

#### Instantaneous Phase Features
- Based on *transient-based RF fingerprinting*.  
- Extract high-order statistical features: **skewness, kurtosis, variance** from:
  - Instantaneous amplitude  
  - Instantaneous frequency  
  - Instantaneous phase  
- These features reflect micro hardware imperfections, creating a unique “fingerprint” for each device.

#### TFED Features
- Use **Hilbert-Huang transform** to analyze signals in the time-frequency domain.  
- Extract feature groups:  
  - **Transient Signal** (e.g., duration, energy, phase entropy)  
  - **Envelope** (e.g., energy, envelope variance)  
  - **TFED-Time** (e.g., slope, variance, energy peak distribution)  
  - **TFED-Frequency** (e.g., peaks, energy variance)  
- Limitation: requires **manual extraction**, depends on accurate transient detection, and can lose information at low sampling rates.

### Signal Classification with RiftNet

    <em>RiftNet architecture</em>
</p>

- RiftNet has **two branches**:  
  - Branch (A): processes long segments (~16 μs).  
  - Branch (B): processes short segments (~2.5 μs).  
- Both use **Dilated Convolutional Cells (DCC)** with different dilation rates to extract multi-scale temporal information.  
- Intermediate outputs are combined with **skip connections** and fed into the classification layer.  
- Advantage: effectively captures RF features, reduces reliance on manual feature extraction.

### Metric Learning and Open Set Problem

- After training **RiftNet**, the softmax layer is removed.  
- Apply **metric learning** with **contrastive loss**, train for **20 additional epochs**.  
- Extract latent vectors of known users and index them using **FAISS** for querying and evaluation.  
- A threshold of **1.0 (Euclidean distance)** in the embedding space separates **known** from **unknown users**.

### Dataset
- Public dataset from Uzundurukan et al. (2020), published in *Data, MDPI*, titled “A Database for the Radio Frequency Fingerprinting of Bluetooth Devices.”

- Dataset link: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3876140
- **Bluetooth (BT)** signals, sampling rate **250 Msps**.  
- **13 devices** from **5 brands**, ~1950 recordings from 33 phones.  
- Data split: **80% train – 20% test**.

## 5. Result

### Machine Learning Classification
- **Instantaneous features**:  
  - SVM: **67.42% (train)**, **42.22% (test)** → low effectiveness.  

- **TFED features**:  
  - LDA: 73.64% (train) / 72.93% (test)  
  - Decision Tree: 100% / 56.57%  
  - Random Forest: 100% / 69.19%  
  - XGBoost: 100% / 70.61%  
  - CatBoost: 99.12% / 72.12%  
  - Gradient Boosting: 99.55% / 65.35%  

👉 Results show **overfitting**: high training accuracy but large drop on test data. Main reason: **difficulty in accurately detecting transient stage**, making manual features (instantaneous, TFED) insufficient.

    <em>Open-set problem on test set (with unknown users)</em>
</p>

- Tested on **mixed dataset** (known + unknown devices):  
  - **Confusion matrix** shows accurate and stable predictions for known classes.  
  - Some misclassifications mainly occur with **unknown class**, normal for open-set.  
  - With **1.0 threshold (Euclidean distance)**, system achieves **97.05% accuracy** in separating known/unknown.
